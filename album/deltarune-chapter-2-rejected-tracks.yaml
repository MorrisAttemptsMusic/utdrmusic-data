    Creating music first can be a useful way to figure out the identity and tone of a boss or scene. However, ideas and characters change, and those initial ideas don't always end up working out…

    So, here's some rejected tracks from the second chapter!

    After creating UNDERTALE, one of my goals for DELTARUNE was for players to finally be able to challenge a "real" version of Mettaton NEO that didn't just end in one turn. For that purpose, I actually created a few music mockups for an extended version of [[track:power-of-neo|Power of NEO]].<br>
    There's even another one from 2016 (lol)

    … Unfortunately, try I might, I could never create a full-length version of the song that I was satisfied with. Eventually, the boss concept evolved to involve Spamton, and with that, the music changed as well.

    I still like the last half of the song. The guitar section was inspired by Brandish's song "Ending 2". All of it is pretty placeholder though.<br>
    It's still fun to imagine fighting something to this... Though, if I was given another opportunity to extend [[track:power-of-neo|POWER OF NEO]], I would probably do something different.

    Unfinished tracks. The drums are especially placeholder.<br>
    Once Spamton's presence in the NEO battle became solidified, I realized the original track wouldn't fit anymore. So, I tried to work in some more sinister and creepy feelings... That idea became this.<br>
    The two tracks are nearly identical, but the "newer" version has different drums and more elements of Spamton's theme in the intro. (It's also even more unfinished...)
