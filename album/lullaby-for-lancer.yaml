    <i>Lena Raine:</i> ([Bandcamp description](https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/lullaby-for-lancer))
    After playing Deltarune, I came away with two very strong opinions: Lancer needed a nap, and Ralsei needed lots of hugs. So I arranged a few tracks from Toby Fox's wonderful OST filled with warm piano & synths to depict these things. Enjoy ðŸ’›
