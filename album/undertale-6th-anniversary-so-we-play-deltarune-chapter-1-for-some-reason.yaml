    If you had a subscription to Famitsu you could get a limited edition PS4 Theme with a cute song.<br>
    Toriel sleeps on a chair, Sans will play the trombone, and Papyrus will chase after the dog stealing a bone.

    In the XBOX version of UNDERTALE, the Dog Shrine is replaced with a Dog Casino.<br>
    The main effect is that it raises the game's age rating to 18+ in Europe due to "gambling."

    There's special dialogue if you get 10000 dog particles in the casino, but it's so difficult to do that no one ever posted it online.<br>
    So I'll put it here.

    I actually really like this arrangement. The only reason I didn't use it was that I was worried about overusing the main theme too much. Instead I decided to make a song based off of the town theme and use it for the school.

    ... What do you think?

    Originally played in the Great Board area.<br>
    However, the area isn't very long, so I felt like if I played a song here, it would actually have the opposite effect of making the area feel disappointing if it had its own unique music but didn't amount to much.

    When I have a song, I feel like I need to do the song justice by having a certain amount of content that goes along with it...

    I started to come up with an epic song for when you first battled Rouxls.<br>
    After starting the song though, I realized... He's not very epic at all.<br>
    Feels like if he had a song like this, you'd actually be able to defeat him in one hit.<br>
    So, I didn't do anything with this one.

    Originally played when Susie joined.<br>
    But it was awkward being frozen for ten seconds.

    I only had the idea for the intro of the song, but it didn't feel like it fit too well.<br>
    So I only made forty seconds of it.

    I made like three different versions of the song.<br>
    This version was pretty good too, but the intro had the wrong atmosphere.

    I actually really like this song and wanted to use it to introduce a leitmotif, but I ended up using a more evocative song with a different motif. I'll try to make an excuse to use the song in the game somewhere.

    The arrangement is really early, but I created this thinking of an animated intro for the game, similar to Wild Arms. I still see it in my head when I listen to the song.

    The best part would have been at the end when everyone is running up the staircase as the silhouettes of the bosses from all the chapters show up, and the Knight, standing in a white door at the top of the stairs, turns around and looks down at them...
