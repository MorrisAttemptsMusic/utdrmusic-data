    Because the anniversary is two days away, I’ll post the music that was unused in the game. (Somehow, it wasn’t very much.)

    This is an early unfinished version of Alphys’ lab. It sounded too similar to a certain lab song from another game, so I scrapped it. While I think [[track:alphys|the new one]] fits Alphys more, the last part of this one is actually pretty cool.

    I think this is the most finished-sounding of all the unused tracks. I made this before I really knew Undyne’s personality, so while the arrangement is good, I felt like it didn’t sound enough like being heroically punched in the face

    Originally I was going to make it if you beat the game fast enough, you’d be able to see the annoying dog in a bikini.

    Before the song “[[track:undertale|UNDERTALE]]” was completed, it went through a completely different iteration. This version sounds a bit more sad, which I think would have been less effective.

    It wasn’t until I heard a certain song that I was inspired to completely change the chords and guitar accompaniment. This new guitar accompaniment then served as the basis for “[[track:memory|Memory]],” so we have a lot to thank that inspiring song for.

    That’s all of the unused songs. See you tomorrow for a brief retrospective on my past year.
