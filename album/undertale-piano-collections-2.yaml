    <i>Materia Collective:</i> ([Bandcamp description](https://materiacollective.bandcamp.com/album/undertale-piano-collections-2), excerpt)
    With this second UNDERTALE Piano Collections, the goal was to revisit the world of Undertale and cover some themes that we didn’t get to explore the first time around, and create some opposing versions of some familiar motifs. As a result, the general feeling of this selection is as if exploring more of the experience and atmosphere of a "genocide run”. Retaining the idea of merging both classical music and video game arrangements, while also continuing the musical language and ideas from the first piano collections, we hope you enjoy these pieces!

    <i>David Peacock:</i> ([Bandcamp track description](https://materiacollective.bandcamp.com/track/ruins))
    Emerging in this new world, we aren’t sure where we are and what’s happened. I wanted to convey this atmosphere with this piece, along with hinting at the active and living world hidden in plain sight.

    <i>David Peacock:</i> ([Bandcamp track description](https://materiacollective.bandcamp.com/track/enemy-approaching-stronger-monsters))
    Battle scenes are unique in Undertale for reasons I don’t likely need to explain, but for the same reason it was fun to explore a more wide variety of feelings with this piece; as you navigate the different dynamics of your encounters. Finally, merging both of these battle tunes into one exciting finish.

    I wanted to convey conflicting feelings to illustrate Toriel’s perspective and need to protect the human from what exists outside. There are moments when a heartbeat rhythmic pulse can be heard, which gets faster and faster until it stops...

    <i>David Peacock:</i> ([Bandcamp track description](https://materiacollective.bandcamp.com/track/sans))
    This arrangement features elements of a tango, along with alternating between heavy and loud, and light and small. Since sans himself can alternate between comical and serious, this is implied here as well (as well as a bit of foreshadowing into a possible future encounter).

    <i>David Peacock:</i> ([Bandcamp track description](https://materiacollective.bandcamp.com/track/mysterious-place-2))
    Arranging this piece was a very fun exercise in creating variations on a theme, and I ended up taking it in many directions. Since the original is rather short, this left more room for expansion, and deciding how mysterious of a place it really is...

    <i>David Peacock:</i> ([Bandcamp track description](https://materiacollective.bandcamp.com/track/dating-start))
    This is an energetic and frantic piece written around the date with Papyrus and the ups and downs that come with it. When there’s a misunderstanding about the nature of their meeting, the piece dissolves temporarily, before returning to a triumphant and exciting finale.

    <i>David Peacock:</i> ([Bandcamp track description](https://materiacollective.bandcamp.com/track/spider-dance-2))
    The spiders in Undertale are generally refined and elegant, and I wanted the arrangement of Spider Dance to mimic that. While paying homage to a couple of classical composers, and exploring the possible grim outcome of an encounter with these spiders, we can see the spider's range of emotions and feelings.

    <i>David Peacock:</i> ([Bandcamp track description](https://materiacollective.bandcamp.com/track/temmie-village-tem-shop))
    Much of this arrangement involved me channeling the feeling I recalled from watching children’s programs as a young child, many of which were accompanied by a pianist live during the taping. I felt this childish texture complemented the Temmie character well.

    <i>David Peacock:</i> ([Bandcamp track description](https://materiacollective.bandcamp.com/track/battle-against-a-true-hero))
    This piece sits squarely in the genocide frame of mind, when you’ve encountered an Undyne who is no longer playing around. The consequences are high, and I wanted to convey the struggle and suggest who I think survives this encounter. Can you guess who?

    <i>David Peacock:</i> ([Bandcamp track description](https://materiacollective.bandcamp.com/track/metal-crusher-3))
    When not being super glamourous, Mettaton represents mischief for much of his time. This can be heard in this arrangement of Metal Crusher, along with elements of the multiple choice gameshow. His flare for drama also shows through in at least a few separate moments!

    Continuing the Mettaton love, we get a softer side of his emotional range. This piece intends to walk a balance of sentiment, operatic gestures, and his melodramatic display of love.

    My own personal send-off to the piano arrangements of Undertale, I wanted to convey the sense of emotion and the journey this motif has taken throughout all of the UNDERTALE Piano Collections pieces, as well as to reinterpret the melody one last time. Thank you for listening!
