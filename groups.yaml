    <i>"The role-playing game where you don't have to kill anyone!"</i>
    <hr class="split">
    Besides being an acclaimed game with its own much-deserved passionate fanbase, the soundtrack of UNDERTALE - single-handedly composed by [[artist:toby-fox]], who also developed the game largely on his own - is well recognized for its extensive use of leitmotifs. Musical themes are reused all throughout the soundtrack; several have even made their way beyond their original context and been referenced by fan musicians in their own Homestuck tracks!
    DELTARUNE is Toby Fox's current project, a continuation of sorts set in an alternate reality; the first chapter has been released for free, and the remaining chapters (and their soundtrack) will be released as a set when the game is complete.
    Much as Homestuck's discography helped foster a community of creation and collaboration, the music and reach of UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE have inspired countless up-and-coming musicians to create remixes and delve into music creation with their own talents and ideas.

Featured Albums:

Description: |-
    Albums from a musical landscape beyond Undertale, by artists with roots in the game's own community.
    <hr class="split">
    Countless artists together made an early abode in the community around Undertale, expanding their sound as they shared their music with other artists and listeners alike; many, in turn, would put their experience into works beyond the webcomic. Some began personal discographies; some scored games and other new projects, finding followings altogether anew; some joined together, collaboratively creating in a spirit inspired by the comic community's own fan-groups.
    Each of these musicians found roots in Undertale, in time branching out beyond; the albums in this area of the wiki are a small selection of what they've gone on to create. We encourage you to delve in and explore; every album is its own unique work, and many familiar faces await within!
